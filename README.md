# Multithreaded-Database-using-UNIX-Shared-Memory-and-Semaphore-APIs

This was developed as a mini project as a part of the course, Unix System Programming in my 4th semester undergrad.

• Developed a simple multithreaded database that demonstrates the usage of Shared Memory and Semaphore APIs.

• Used over 10 Semaphore APIs and Shared Memory System Calls.

• Implemented input, search, modify, print, and export operations that can be performed on the database.

• The export operation lets the user to export the database to multiple file formats such as csv, txt, etc
